* There are many famous places in Vietnam, but my favorite is Da Nang. It has beautiful beaches and high mountains, so I can enjoy both swimming and hiking. I especially like taking the cable car to the top of the mountain because the view of the sea is amazing. Many foreigners also visit Da Nang because it’s a very beautiful city.



* Last year, I traveled alone to Da Nang, which is a famous city in Vietnam. I climbed a mountain there because the view was so beautiful, but I lost my wallet while taking pictures. I was really worried because my ID and money were inside. It was a scary experience, and now I always check my wallet carefully when I travel.



* Many people like to travel for different reasons. Some want to see new places, and others want to make new friends. For me, the best reason to travel is to relieve stress. When I travel, I can relax, enjoy beautiful views, and forget about my busy life. That’s why I think traveling is very important for everyone.




* I like traveling to Da Nang because it’s famous for its beautiful sea. When I go there, I always bring sunscreen, a hat, and a swimsuit. The sun is very strong, so sunscreen is a must. I also take many pictures and wear nice clothes. Of course, having enough money is important because traveling costs a lot.
