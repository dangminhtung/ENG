* Before jogging, I change into comfortable and light clothes so I can move easily and absorb sweat. I think choosing the right shoes is the most important thing because uncomfortable shoes can hurt my feet or ankles. When I jog in the park, I usually listen to music for about an hour. After that, I sit on a bench, eat some snacks, and drink water to relax and regain energy.


* I don’t remember the first time I went to the park, but I think I started going there when I was in high school because of my mom. At that time, I was under a lot of stress from studying, and I often felt tired and had headaches. I asked my mom for advice, and she suggested regular exercise. So I started jogging in a big park near my house every evening. After about a month, I felt healthier and much less stressed, so I still go to the park to exercise regularly.
=> I don’t remember when I first went to the park, but I started going there in high school because of my mom. I was very stressed from studying and often felt tired. My mom suggested regular exercise, so I began jogging in a park near my house. After about a month, I felt healthier and less stressed, and I still go there to exercise.



* The most memorable experience I had at the park happened a few months ago. I was jogging in my favorite park when it suddenly started to rain heavily. I didn’t check the weather forecast and didn’t bring an umbrella, so I got completely wet. The road was slippery and dark, and I fell and hurt my knee. A stranger helped me and took me to the hospital. Since then, I always check the weather forecast before going out.




* I usually go for a walk in a park near my house. I often listen to music, so I prefer going alone because it’s hard to focus when I go with others. The park has many trees and a lake, so the air is very fresh. There are also exercise facilities and jogging tracks, which help people relieve stress. I usually jog on a small path near the lake, and listening to music while enjoying the scenery makes me feel relaxed and energized.

* The most memorable experience I had at the park happened last weekend. I was jogging near a lake in a park close to my house, but I was wearing shoes that were not suitable for jogging. I kept paying attention to my shoes, stumbled, and fell down, hurting my knee. My phone was broken, so I couldn’t call anyone and had to go home by myself. Since then, I always make sure to wear the right shoes when I jog.

* It’s important to wear comfortable and light clothes when jogging. I usually wear functional clothes because they absorb sweat well and keep me cool. They also stretch easily, so I can exercise comfortably. I think choosing the right shoes is the most important thing. If the shoes are not comfortable, my feet or ankles can hurt. That’s why I prefer soft and light sneakers when I jog.

* When I exercise, sportswear is very important. In the past, I just wore shorts and a T-shirt, but they didn’t absorb sweat, so they were uncomfortable. Now I wear functional clothes because they absorb sweat well and stretch easily. I also wear soft and light sneakers to protect my feet, so they don’t hurt even after exercising for a long time.

* The road I usually use has changed a lot. In the past, it was narrow but quiet, and there were many tall trees, so it was cool and comfortable. I used to walk there in the evening and sit with my friends, talking about our day or movies. Now the road is wider, but the trees are gone, and there is a lot of dust and traffic. It feels more dangerous, so I really miss the comfortable atmosphere of the old road.
