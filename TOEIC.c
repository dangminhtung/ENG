    I think this picture was taken at a bakery. There are two people in this picture. The man on the right is wearing a blue shirt. He must be a customer because he seems to be at the counter waiting to buy something. The woman in the middle/center is wearing a white jacket or uniform  and a black cap to cover her hair. I think she must be a  baker. It looks like she just took the tray of bread out of the oven. The oven is behind her. Maybe customer was waiting to buy some of the deliciuos bread.

    I think this picture was taken at an office. There are two people in this picture.The young man on the left is wearing a white shirt. He must be a technology expert because he seems to be repairing or installing computer parts. The older man is sitting behind the desk and he is wearing glasses. There is a computer unit on the right side of the table and the older man is watching the younger man fix his computer. This scene could be from a computer repair class or a training session, where the older man might be a teacher or supervisor.

    I think this picture was taken at a supermarket. There are two people in this picture. They are dressed casually and each of them is holding a shopping cart. The woman on the left is wearing a light-colored shirt and appears to be pointing at something while talking to the other woman. The woman on the right is wearing a darker shirt and has her hand on her hip, listening to the conversation. Behind them, merchandise is neatly arranged on the shelves. It looks like a casual and friendly moment during a shopping trip.

    *! merchandise: mở chừn đai
    *! neatly: nít li - gọn gàng
