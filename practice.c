/*
todo : there is famous destinations in vietnam, but among them , i like da nang. not only is the beach very long , but the da nang is famous for its beatuful place so it is always crowded with people who enjoy consistent bathing here but rest under the trees on the beach. if you lie on the sand and look up, you can see many high mountains, so it is enjoyable to climb them after enjoying consistent bathing. also , it is very high mountain, so it convenient to take a cable car across the sea to the oppsite island to reach the top of the mountain. when you look down at the sea from the cable car, it is little scary but scenery is so beautiful that you can feel the excitement. so not only vietnameese but also foreigners often to da nang
